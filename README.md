>This is experimental work in progress.

Tools for migrating (importing/exporting) Cadmus data.

## Cadmus.Export.ML

This library contains components used to export Cadmus data into some markup language (typically XML).

- `TokenTextExporter`: core logic to export token-based text with layers into markup. For a related HTML visualization see [this brick](https://github.com/vedph/cadmus-bricks-shell/tree/master/projects/myrmidon/cadmus-text-block-view).
